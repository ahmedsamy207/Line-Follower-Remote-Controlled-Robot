# Line-Follower-Remote-Controlled-Robot
In this project, We built a remote-controlled car that has two modes of operation: manual and line-follower. The car’s mode can be selected by means of a web app or an Android application. The car can also be operated in manual mode using the same application. In either mode, the user can set the car’s speed by means of a slider.
